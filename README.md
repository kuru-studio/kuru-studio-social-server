## Version

## Set-up
You need to have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine to be able to run the following commands. You also need to setup the `config/master.key` before running the commands to make sure that everything will work fine.
```
# Open your default terminal and run the following
➜ docker-compose build                                    # Builds the project
➜ docker-compose run web rake db:create                   # Builds the database
➜ docker-compose up                                       # Starts the server
```

## Installing a new Gem
To install a new gem please edit the `Gemfile` and run the following commands afterwards.
```
# Open your default terminal and run the following
➜ docker-compose down                                     # Stops the server
➜ docker-compose run web bundle install                   # Run 'bundle install' inside the container
➜ docker-compose up --build                               # Starts and rebuilds the project
```

## Extra commands
For other cases please check the commands below.
```
# Open your default terminal and run the following
➜ docker-compose run web rails db:migrate                 # Run the migration
➜ docker-compose run web rails console                    # Open the rails console
➜ docker-compose run web rake routes |grep 'test_courses' # List routes with 'test_courses' in it
➜ docker attach <CONTAINER_NAME>                          # Attach to the application container (for when you're trying to use Debugger/Byebug)
```

### Updating the environment credentials
Rails takes care of our credentials. To update them, please do the following.
```
# Enter bash inside the docker container
➜ docker-compose build                                    # Builds the project
➜ docker-compose run web bash                             # Enter bash inside the docker container
➜ EDITOR="vim" rails credentials:edit                     # Edit the credentials inside the docker container using Vim
```
